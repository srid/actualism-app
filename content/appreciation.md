Considering that depreciation tends to be the norm in human psyche, appreciation counters it such that one can up-level one's level enjoyment, e.g.: going from feeling good to feeling great. To begin with, when you are feeling good, then *appreciate* feeling good which may well have the effect of feeling great instantly.

> To understand the word appreciation you can look at its opposite - depreciation = devaluation, cheapening, reduction in value, disparage. Hence appreciation means assessing of the true worth or value of persons or things and thus adding value, enriching, encouraging (the expansion of your value assessment), highly regarding, cherishing, [marvelling](http://www.an.actualfreedom.com.au/various/well-equippedmarvelling.htm).

> Appreciation is the very key to **exponentially** increase the level of your enjoyment, expand it in scope and depth, so that you are able to see more and more how the universe is happening with wondrous perfection in all the various, minute and large, details of life and matter. Encouraging [naivet√©](http://an.actualfreedom.com.au/various/aclay-pittale.htm) is an essential ingredient to marvelling, delight and wonderment.
