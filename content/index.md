# Srid's Actualism Practice

One becomes an [actualist](https://actualfreedom.com.au/an/) by practicing the **method** (_The Actualism Method_) until it segues into the **process** (_The Actualism Process_). By resurrecting **naiveté**, one can more easily tackle the **social identity** such as to make the method easy and effortless. Once the *process* is finished, you are **actually free** from the human condition.

## The Method

### Level 1
            
Achieve **feeling good** as the default baseline mood.

- Identify your top-most issue in life; then plan your life such as to periodically put yourself in situations that bring it to the fore.
  - Using the method described immediately below, dissolve this issue with [naiveté](#naivete), thereby channeling the affective energy significantly.
- Whenever feeling bad, first get back to feeling good.
  - To do this, [notice](#awareness) your ongoing habit of *feeding* the feeling (including attempts to 'change' it), and cease doing that. Cease everything but be ([simply](#naivete)) be [aware](#awareness) of the feeling.
    - When you do this, the body's [native intelligence](#intelligence) will automatically see the feeling to be silly, and you are back to feeling good.
- Once feeling good, explore (in memory) *why* you felt bad.
  - Try to comprehend *how* "you" operate, while enjoying this exploration and reflection!
- The body's [native intelligence](#intelligence) will do the rest
  - Prevalence and intensity of bad feelings (and this top-most issue) will decrease over time, with "you" becoming ever more [naive](#naivete).

### Level 2

Achieve **feeling excellent** as the default baseline mood, by making [naiveté](#naivete) second nature.

If you remember a PCE, seek to rememorate it! Srid, the author, seeks to rememorate the flavour of [his PCE](https://srid.ca/pce-reports#ms) in both environmental and social contexts.

TODO (beer rather doer; go out from under control; seeing 'me' to be fraud and ultimately desiring death, give permission to self-immolate)
