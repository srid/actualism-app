# Srid's Actualism Practice

One becomes an [actualist](https://actualfreedom.com.au/an/) by practicing the **method** (_The Actualism Method_) until it segues into the **process** (_The Actualism Process_). By resurrecting **naiveté**, one can more easily tackle the **social identity** such as to make the method easy and effortless. Once the *process* is finished, you are **actually free** from the human condition.

## The Method

:::box

Put succintly, the actualism method is **an ongoing enjoyment and appreciation of this moment of being alive** (read [This Moment of Being Alive](https://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm) for details).

### Level 1
            
Achieve **feeling good** as the default baseline mood.

- Identify your top-most issue in life; then plan your life such as to periodically put yourself in situations that bring it to the fore.
  - Using the method described immediately below, dissolve this issue with [naiveté](#naivete), thereby channeling the affective energy significantly.
- Whenever feeling bad, first get back to feeling good.
  - To do this, [notice](#awareness) your ongoing habit of *feeding* the feeling (including attempts to 'change' it), and cease doing that. Cease everything but be ([simply](#naivete)) be [aware](#awareness) of the feeling.
    - When you do this, the body's [native intelligence](#intelligence) will automatically see the feeling to be silly, and you are back to feeling good.
- Once feeling good, explore (in memory) *why* you felt bad.
  - Try to comprehend *how* "you" operate, while enjoying this exploration and reflection!
- The body's [native intelligence](#intelligence) will do the rest
  - Prevalence and intensity of bad feelings (and this top-most issue) will decrease over time, with "you" becoming ever more [naive](#naivete).

### Level 2

Achieve **feeling great/excellent** as the default baseline mood, by making [naiveté](#naivete) second nature. Is there something -- an affective habit (possibly developed in early childhood) -- that is preventing you from being [naive](#naivete) (and [intelligent](#intelligence)) by default?

:::srid
Srid had to [identify, in real-time](#awareness), the early childhood affective habit of being *put down* by his then peers and adults, and thereby effortlessly channel that affective energy into feeling great, which brought more to fore his freed intelligence (otherwise kept suppressed by the habit) with the concomitant enthusiasm for living itself.

Bonus: If you remember a PCE, seek to rememorate it! 

:::srid
Srid seeks to rememorate the flavour of [his PCE](https://srid.ca/pce-reports#ms) in both environmental and social contexts.

## The Process

:::box
TODO (beer rather doer; go out from under control; seeing 'me' to be fraud and ultimately desiring death, give permission to self-immolate)
