# Srid's Actualism Practice

One becomes an [actualist](https://actualfreedom.com.au/an/) by practicing the **method** (_The Actualism Method_) until it segues into the **process** (_The Actualism Process_). By resurrecting **naiveté**, one can more easily tackle the **social identity** such as to make the method easy and effortless. Once the *process* is finished, you are **actually free** from the human condition.

## The Method

:::box

Put succintly, the actualism method is **an ongoing enjoyment and appreciation of this moment of being alive** (read [This Moment of Being Alive](https://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm) for details).

### Level 1
            
Achieve **feeling good** as the default baseline mood.

- Whenever feeling bad, first get back to feeling good.
  - To do this, [notice](#awareness) your ongoing habit of *feeding* the feeling (including attempts to 'change' it), and cease doing that. Cease everything but ([simply](#naivete)) be [aware](#awareness) of the feeling.
    - When you do this, the body's [native intelligence](#intelligence) will automatically see the feeling to be silly, and you are back to feeling good.
- Once feeling good, explore (in memory) *why* you felt bad.
  - Try to comprehend *how* "you" operate, while enjoying this exploration and reflection!
- The body's [native intelligence](#intelligence) will do the rest
  - Prevalence and intensity of bad feelings (and the larger habit/pattern) will decrease over time, with "you" becoming ever more [naive](#naivete).

Srid personally first identified his top-most issue in life; then planned it such as to periodically put himself in situations that brought it more to the fore. Then, he began using the actualism method to weaken this top-most issue with [naiveté](#naivete), thereby channeling the affective energy significantly into feeling good as a bottomline.

### Level 2

Achieve **feeling great/excellent** as the default baseline mood, by making [naiveté](#naivete) second nature. 

- Is there something -- an affective habit (possibly developed in early childhood) -- that is retarding you from being [naive](#naivete) (and [intelligent](#intelligence)) by default? Become [aware](#awareness) of it, and gently channel it.
  - [Srid had to [identify, in real-time](#awareness), the early childhood affective habit of being *put down* by his then peers and adults, and thereby effortlessly channel that affective energy into feeling great, which brought more to fore his freed intelligence (otherwise kept suppressed by the habit) with the concomitant enthusiasm for living itself.]{.srid}
- If there seems to be nothing particular holding you back, then - if you are feeling good, [genuinely appreciate](#appreciation) feeling good, which may well have the effect of feeling great instantly.
- Bonus: If you remember a PCE, seek to rememorate it! 
  - [Srid seeks to rememorate the flavour of [his PCE](https://srid.ca/pce-reports#ms) in both environmental and social contexts.]{.srid}

## The Process

TODO (beer rather doer; go out from under control; seeing 'me' to be fraud and ultimately desiring death, give permission to self-immolate)
