**Naiveté** is a way of being wherein we can finally lay down the burden of being a controlling social identity, and live life absorbed and revelling in each and every moment as it unfolds (there is no past or future, thus no hope/expectation and dissapointment), and thereby be likeable and liking (via getting as close to what one is as possible, ie. this flesh and blood body).

It  is the path to stepping out from being under control which is necessary to become fully free.

If you are enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive (i.e. right here; right now), keep doing what you are doing. **But if not**, something's wrong - change your approach. It is always useful to start afresh - via the openness & spontaneity of naiveté.

[Conditional enjoyment](#condenj) is the norm. Allow it in the beginning. Recognizing it to be the part of the same hope/disappointment cycle, however, you can [channel](#choice) that affective energy (as this moment unfolds) into being more sensuous which inheres to being alive.
